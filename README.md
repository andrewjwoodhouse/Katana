#Katana

This is a simple learning project (for me!) that uses Silk (https://github.com/SoftCircuits/Silk) to provide a simple programming language with graphical and text components.

Implemented functions are:

	    "Print"
             "Debug"
             "Println"
             "TextFormat"
             "uiMsg"
             "DrawLine"
             "DrawPixel"
             "DrawCircle"
             "DrawEllipse"
             "DrawFilledCircle"
             "DrawCurve"
             "DrawPolygon"
             "DrawFilledPolygon"
             "DrawText"
             "TextColor"
             "SetFont"
             "ClearText"
             "ClearCanvas"
             "Sleep"
